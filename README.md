# cypress-bdd
This repository provides an integration between Cypress, a modern end-to-end testing framework, and Cucumber, a powerful behavior-driven development (BDD) tool. It offers a robust and efficient testing solution that combines the flexibility and ease of use of Cypress with the expressiveness and collaboration features of Cucumber.
